PUBS 2015 Bioinformatics Workshop
=================================

We discuss the role of bioinformatics in biomedical research and provide a workshop to highlight the benefits of creating reproducible bioinformatics workflows using free, and open-source software. We will give a hands-on demonstration using Galaxy, a web-based platform for biomedical research, as an example of open-source bioinformatics software that enables scientists to create reproducible and shareable workflows in a user-friendly environment.

[Section 1](Section1/Section1.md)
------------------------

The first section of the workshop demonstrates using tools in Galaxy by walking through the steps required to do basic sequence annotation on a public instance of Galaxy. We assume the reader has no previous experience with Galaxy.


[Section 2](Section2/Section2.md)
------------------------

This section of the workshop tasks the reader with creating a workflow for the sequence annotation procedure performed in Section 1. We assume the reader has completed Section 1 of this workshop.

[Exercises](Section2/Exercises.md)
------------------------

The exercises include multiple datasets and exercises for running and troubleshooting the workflow created in Section 2. We assume the reader has completed Section 2 of this workshop.

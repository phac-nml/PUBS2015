2. If the workflow does not complete correctly, what is the source of the problem?
    
3. How do the sequence annotations look?
    
### Exercise 2: R. sphaeroides Chromosome Annotation ###

1. Execute the sequence annotation workflow on the R. sphaeroides chromosomal data:

    https://github.com/emarinier/PUBS2015/raw/master/data/reads/Rsphaeroides.fastq

2. If the workflow does not complete correctly, what is the source of the problem?
    
3. Can you suggest any improvements to the workflow?

### Exercise 3: Unknown Sequence Data Annotation ###

1. Execute the sequence annotation workflow on the unknown sequence data:

    https://github.com/emarinier/PUBS2015/raw/master/data/reads/unknown.fastq

2. If the workflow does not complete correctly, what is the source of the problem?
    
3. Is there any information in the workflow you can use to determine the species?
    
4. What popular bioinformatics tool might be useful in determining the species?

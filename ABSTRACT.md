Abstract
========

We discuss the role of bioinformatics in biomedical research and provide a workshop to highlight the benefits of creating reproducible bioinformatics workflows using free, and open-source software. We will give a hands-on demonstration using Galaxy, a web-based platform for biomedical research, as an example of open-source bioinformatics software that enables scientists to create reproducible and shareable workflows in a user-friendly environment.
